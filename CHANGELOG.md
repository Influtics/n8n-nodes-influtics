# Changelog

All notable changes to `n8n-nodes-influtics` are documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), versioning follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- Published `1.0.0` tarball was empty (LICENSE + README + package.json only — no `dist/`). n8n surfaced it as `Error loading package: Unexpected token '*'` because the `dist/nodes/**/*.node.js` glob resolved to nothing. The `prepublishOnly` script is now wired so `npm publish` always builds, lints, and tests first; v1.0.1 ships the missing `dist/` artifacts.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-24

First public community-node release. Covers the full Influtics public REST API surface:

- InfluticsApi credential (single Bearer API key).
- InfluticsVideo node (5 operations).
- InfluticsBlogger node (3 operations, async Track returns job_id).
- InfluticsTrend node (1 operation).
- InfluticsAccount node (2 operations).
- GenericFunctions transport + error mapper.
- Vitest + nock test suite.
- GitHub Actions CI (lint + test on every push/PR).
